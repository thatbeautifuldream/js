# Arithmatic Operators

- As the name suggests, the arithmatic operators are used to perform arithmatic operations.
- The arithmatic operators are:

  - Addition (+)
  - Subtraction (-)
  - Multiplication (\*)
  - Division (/)
  - Modulus (%)
  - Exponentiation (\*\*)
  - Increment (++)
  - Decrement (--)

- The addition operator is used to add two numbers, just like

```js
var a = 10;
var b = 20;
var sum = a + b;
document.write(sum);
```

> document.write() is a function that is used to write text to the browser, in this case, it will write the sum of a and b to the browser.

- The subtraction operator is used to subtract two numbers, just like

```js
var a = 10;
var b = 20;
var difference = a - b;
document.write(difference);
```

- The multiplication operator is used to multiply two numbers, just like

```js
var a = 3;
var b = 5;
var multiply = a * b;
document.write(multiply);
```

- The division operator is used to divide two numbers, just like

```js
var a = 10;
var b = 20;
var divide = a / b;
document.write(divide);
```

- The modulus operator is used to find the remainder of two numbers, just like

```js
var a = 3;
var b = 5;
var modulus = a % b; // 3
document.write(modulus);
```

> The remainder of two numbers (a % b) is the number that remains after the division of a by b.

- The exponentiation operator is used to raise a number to a power, just like

```js
var a = 3;
var b = 5;
var exponent = a ** b; // 243
document.write(exponent);
```

- The increment operator is used to increment a number by 1, just like

```js
var a = 10;
a++;
document.write(a); // 11
```

- The decrement operator is used to decrement a number by 1, just like

```js
var a = 10;
a--;
document.write(a); // 9
```

## Quiz Time!

- What is the value of answer after executing the following code?

```js
var a = 10;
var b = 20;
var answer = a + (10 * b) / 2;
```

- Answer : `answer = a + (10 * b) / 2 = 10 + 200 / 2 = 10 + 100 = 110`
