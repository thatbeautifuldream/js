# Objects in JavaScript

- Objects are collections of properties, which are named values that are associated with the object.
- Objects are similar to arrays, except that objects are not ordered.
- Objects are useful for storing data.

## Object Syntax

```js
var person = {
  name: "John",
  age: 30,
};
```

- Here we have created an object named person, with two properties: name and age.
- The name property has a value of "John".
- The age property has a value of 30.

## Accessing Object Properties

- To access the value of a property, we use dot notation.

```js
var person = {
  name: "Mike",
  age: 33,
};
console.log(person.name);
console.log(person.age);
```

- The other way to access the value of a property is by using bracket notation.

```js
var person = {
  name: "John",
  age: 30,
};
console.log(person["name"]);
```

- To find out the size of the object, we can use the `length` property.

```js
var person = {
  name: "John",
  age: 30,
};
console.log(person.length);
```

- This will print out the number of properties in the object, here being 2.

## Object Methods

- The objects can also include methods as part of their definition.
- Methods are functions that are associated with an object as properties.

```js
var person = {
  name: "John",
  age: 30,
  sayHello: function () {
    alert("Hello " + this.name);
  },
};
person.sayHello();
```

- The `sayHello` method is a method of the person object and can be called on the person object using the dot notation and the `()` brackets since it is a function basically.
