# The Object Constructor

- Previously we created objects using the object literal syntax.

```js
var person = {
  name: "John",
  age: 30,
};
```

- This allows us to create a single object only.
- In order to create multiple objects, we need to use the constructor function, so we can define object types.

```js
function Person(name, age) {
  this.name = name;
  this.age = age;
}
```

- This is a standard way of creating constructor function, here the this keyword is used to refer to the object that is being created.
- this is a reserved keyword in JavaScript, so we can't use it as a variable name.
- The constructor function is called with the new keyword, so we can create multiple objects.

```js
var person1 = new Person("John", 30);
var person2 = new Person("Sara", 25);
console.log(person1, person2);
```

- This creates two objects, each with their own properties as defined in the parameters.
- The new keyword is used to create a new object, and the constructor function is called with the new keyword.
