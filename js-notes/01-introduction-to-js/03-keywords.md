Keywords are reserved words that are part of the syntax in the programming language. For example,

Here is the list of some keywords available in JavaScript.

<table>
<tr>
    <td>const</td>
    <td>let</td>
    <td>var</td>
    <td>for</td>
    <td>function</td>
</tr>
  <tr>
    <td>return</td>
    <td>if</td>
    <td>else</td>
    <td>try</td>
    <td>catch</td>
</tr>
  <tr>
    <td>do</td>
    <td>while</td>
    <td>break</td>
    <td>continue</td>
    <td>await</td>
</tr>
  <tr>
    <td>async</td>
    <td>switch</td>
    <td>class</td>
    <td>import</td>
    <td>new</td>
</tr>
</table>

These words cannot be used as identifiers. These keywords are used for different purposes to complete your code.

```js
const a = "hello";
```

Here, `const` is a keyword that denotes that **a** is a constant.
`a` is an identifier and it cannot be from the list of keywords present in js.

We will learn about the meaning of individual keywords as we progress in the course.
