# The return statement

- The return statement is optional in a function.
- It is used to return a value from a function.
- It is used when we need to make some calculations and return the result.

## Syntax

```js
function add(num1, num2) {
  return num1 + num2;
}
```

- Here the function add returns the sum of two numbers.

## Working with return statements

- The return statement is optional in a function, but if it is used, it must be the last statement in the function because it will stop the function.
