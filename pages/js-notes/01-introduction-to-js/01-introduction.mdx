### What is JS?

3 core languages used to build a web app - HTML, CSS & JavaScript.

1. **HTML** - HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages. All those buttons that you see on a website!
2. **CSS** - CSS is the language we use to style a Web page. All those colors, animations that you see on a like button!
3. **JS** - JavaScript is a scripting language of the web that allows you to do Interactivity with User-Events, implement Conditions and Validations, Dynamic updates in a Web Page, etc. All the logic when you hit that like button!
