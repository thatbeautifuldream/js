# Data Types in JavaScript

- Data types are used to define the type of data that a variable can hold
- In JavaScript, there are six data types:
  - Number
  - String
  - Boolean
  - Object
  - Array
  - Function
- These data types are classified as primitive data types (or simple data types) and complex data types (which are objects).

- Primitive data types are the simplest data types.
- Number : A number is a data type that represents a numeric value.
  > A number can be a whole number (integer), a decimal number (float), or a negative number.
- String : A string is a data type that represents text.
  > A string can be a single character, a word, or a sentence.
- Boolean : A boolean is a data type that represents a true or false value.
  > A boolean can be true or false.
- Null : A null is a data type that represents the intentional absence of a value.
  > A null value is often used to represent the absence of a value and can be explicitly assigned to a variable.
- Undefined : A undefined is a data type that represents the intentional absence of a value.
  > A undefined value is often used to represent the absence of a value which is not yet defined.
- Object : An object is a data type that represents a collection of data.
  > An object is a collection of data that is stored in key-value pairs.
- Array : An array is a data type that represents a list of data.
  > An array is a list of data that is stored in a sequential order.
- Function : A function is a data type that represents a block of code.
  > A function is a block of code that is used to perform a specific task.

## Quiz

```js
var number = 10;
var string = "Hello";
var boolean = true;
var nullValue = null;
var undefinedValue = undefined;
var object = {};
var array = [];
var functionValue = function () {};
```

## Some extra notes

- Strings enclosed in double quotes if include a double quote, it will be treated as the end of the string, hence escape the double quote using the escape character \"
