# Comparison Opertors

- We can use comparison operators to compare values and expressions.
- We get either true or false.
- For example (==) checks whether the operands' values are equal.

```js
var a = 10;
console.log(a == 10); // true
```

> In javascript we have two types of equality operators (== is loose and === is strict).
> The loose equality operator (==) is used to compare values.
> The strict equality operator (===) is used to check whether the operands' values and types are equal.

```js
var a = 10;
var b = "10";
console.log(a == b); // true
console.log(a === b); // false
```

- Here for the strict equality operator (===) we get false because the types are not equal (number and string).

## List of Comparison Operators

| Operator | Description           | Example |
| -------- | --------------------- | ------- |
| ==       | Equal                 | a == b  |
| ===      | Strict Equal          | a === b |
| !=       | Not Equal             | a != b  |
| !==      | Strict Not Equal      | a !== b |
| >        | Greater Than          | a > b   |
| <        | Less Than             | a < b   |
| >=       | Greater Than or Equal | a >= b  |
| <=       | Less Than or Equal    | a <= b  |

```js
var a = 1024;
var b = "1 GB";
console.log(a == b); // ?
```
