# The if statement

- The if statement is used to execute a block of code if a condition is true

```js
if (condition) {
  // code to execute
}
```

## Example

```js
var a = 100;
var b = 20;
if (a > b) {
  // Condition is true so the if block gets executed
  console.log("a is greater than b");
}
```
