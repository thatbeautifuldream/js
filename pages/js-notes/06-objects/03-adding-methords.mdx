# Methords

- Methords are functions that are attached to objects properties.
- We use the following syntax to create a methord:

```js
methordName = function () {
  // code goes here
};
```

- Access an object's methord:

```js
objectName.methordName();
```

- A methord is a function belonging to an object, it can be referenced using the this keyword.
- `this` keyword is used as a reference to the object that the methord belongs to

- Defining methords is done inside the constructor function.

```js
function person(name, age) {
  this.name = name;
  this.age = age;
  this.sayName = function () {
    console.log(this.name);
  };
}

var p = new person("John", 30);
p.sayName();
```

## Methords can be defined outside of the constructor function

```js
function person(name, age) {
  this.name = name;
  this.age = age;
  this.yearOfBirth = bornYear;
}
function bornYear() {
  return 2016 - this.age;
}
```

- As you can see, we have assigned the object's yearOfBirth property to the bornYear function.
- The this keyword is used to access the age property of the object, which is going to call the method.
- Note that it is not nessasary to write the function's parenthesis when calling the methord.
- We call the methord by the property name.

```js
function person(name, age) {
  this.name = name;
  this.age = age;
  this.yearOfBirth = bornYear;
}
function bornYear() {
  return 2016 - this.age;
}

var p = new person("A", 22);

document.write(p.yearOfBirth());
```

- Note : In order to use the objects properties within a funtion use the this keyword
