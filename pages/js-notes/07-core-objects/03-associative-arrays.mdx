# Associative Arrays

- While many programming languages support arrays with named indexes, JavaScript does not.
- These are called associative arrays, in JavaScript, these are rather treated as objects.
- So, in JavaScript, when we use a named array syntax, we are actually using an object.

## Example

- Representing a person.

```js
var person = []; // empty array
person["firstName"] = "John";
person["lastName"] = "Doe";
person["age"] = 50;
console.log(person); // {firstName: "John", lastName: "Doe", age: 50}
```

- Here the person array gets treated as an object.
- Hence the standard array methods are not available, and yeild different results.
- Like person.length will return 0. Which is an array property and not an object property.
- But person.hasOwnProperty("firstName") will return true. Which is a valid property for object.
