# setInterval()

- setInterval() is a method of the window object (browser) that executes a function or a string of JavaScript code at specified intervals (in milliseconds).
- It will continue to execute the function or the JavaScript code until clearInterval() is called on the interval ID.

## Example

```js
function myAlert() {
  alert("Hello World!");
}
setInterval(myAlert, 1000);
```

- This will call the function myAlert() every second.
- Here 1000 milliseconds is 1 second.
- Note : Here the myAlert is passed without the parenthesis in the setInterval() method.

## Quick Quiz

- Fill in the blanks to call the calc() every 3 seconds:

```js
function calc() {
  console.log(Math.random() * 10);
}

setInterval(___, ___);
```

## The Date object

- The Date object is a part of the JavaScript language.
- It is used to represent a date and time.
- It is used to get the current date and time.
- It consists of methods to get the current date, time, year and so on.
- Using the new Date(), we can create a new Date object with the current date and time.

## Creating a new Date object

```js
var today = new Date();
```

- The other way to create a new Date object is to pass the date and time as arguments to the new Date() method.

```js
var today = new Date(year, month, day, hours, minutes, seconds, milliseconds);
```

- Js Dates are calculated from 01 January, 1970. 00:00:00 (UTC)
- One day contains 86,400,000 milliseconds.
- One hour contains 3,600,000 milliseconds.
- One minute contains 60,000 milliseconds.
- One second contains 1,000 milliseconds.

## Example

```js
// Fri Jan 02 1970 00:00:00
var d1 = new Date(86400000);

// Sat Jan 03 1970 00:00:00
var d2 = new Date(86400000 * 2);
```

- JavaScript counts months from 0 to 11 (January to December).
- The computer time is ticking but the date object does not.

## Quick Quiz

- Q. What information results from creating a Date object with the new Date() method?

> A. The current date and time.
> B. The current date.
> C. The current time.
> D. The current year.

## Date Methods

- When a Date object is created, a number of methods make it possible to get information about the date and time.

... and many more.

## For Example

```js
var today = new Date();
today.getDate();
today.getDay();
today.getFullYear();
today.getHours();
```

- Lets say we want to develop a function printTime() that prints the current time to browser every second.

```js
function printTime() {
  var d = new Date();
  var hours = d.getHours();
  var minutes = d.getMinutes();
  var seconds = d.getSeconds();
  document.body.innerHTML = hours + ":" + minutes + ":" + seconds;
}
setInterval(printTime, 1000);
```

- We declared a function printTime() that prints the current time to browser every second by using setInterval() method.

- The innerHTML property of the document.body object is used to write the content of the page.
