# Template Literals in ES6

- Template literals are string literals that use backticks (`) instead of quotation marks (")
- Prior to ES6, you had to use concatenation to join strings together.
- Template literals allow you to use variables and expressions in your strings.

```js
let name = "John";
let age = 25;
console.log("My name is " + name + " and I am " + age + " years old."); // prior to ES6
console.log(`My name is ${name} and I am ${age} years old.`); // ES6
```

- ES6 introduced a new way to write strings, new way to output strings is using template literals.
- We use backticks (`) instead of quotation marks (") to create template literals.
- Template literals can use variables and expressions.
- Template literals are enclosed by the backticks (`) and the contents of the template literal can be separated by ${}
- Template literals can be multiline.
- Template literals can be used to output HTML.
- The ${expression} is called a template expression and has a placeholder for the result of the expression.
- To escape the backtick (`) character, you can use the backslash (\).
